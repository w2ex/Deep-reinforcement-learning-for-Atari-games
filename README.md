# Deep-reinforcement-learning-for-Atari-games

## Required

_Tensorflow (version 0.12.1)(https://www.tensorflow.org/install/)

_ALE (https://github.com/mgbellemare/Arcade-Learning-Environment)

This has been done using Python 2.7. Using Python 3.5+ will require to use Tensorflow 1.0+ and might require to change some lines of the script (some Tensorflow functions have been renamed or deprecated on the newer versions).

## Instructions

The script to run to train the network is DeepQLearninUP.py. It uses the rom breakout.bin (can be set in the python script). Results will be saved on logs_atari.
